## Why Scripty?
- Easy to use
- Not busy with switching keyboard

### Problem

There are many keyboards out there for typing superscript and subscript.

However, It's not easy to use for eveyone.

For example, if we need to type `H₂O`,

then we have to switch specific keyboard just to type `₂`.

Then I have to switch back my keyboard again.

That's so annoying for users just for typing superscript and subscript.

### Solution

Now we have `Scripty`, when we need to type `H₂O`,

just open `Scripty` app and choose what you want to type,

and type `superscript` and `subscript`.

No matter whatever keyboard you are using.

## Upcoming Features

- will able to save specific words, example `e = mc²`
- will able to copy from saved words
- will able to export all saved words as `image`, `json` and `csv`
